So this song is really personal to me, but hopefully and seemingly to other people, too, which has been really amazing and fulfilling to know that it's been touching people the way that I hoped it would. Yeah, I know. That's pretty cool. Yeah. No, I said, I think they misunderstood. I said, it's okay. I'm a rule breaker. I can do this. But they misunderstood and said I'm a proofreader. But I was just making a really dumb joke. I was nervous. Shania Twain was there, and I just didn't think. I was just spewing out words. But I knew that I was going to forget people, so I had to take out my piece of paper. Next year, I'm hoping to just hide away and make new music. I'm hoping to just disappear and come out of my little cave when I'm ready. But, yeah, we'll see what happens. Oh, thank you. I don't even know if I technically could because it's not really mine. I'm just the voice on it. But I would love to. I mean, that's such a beautiful song, and I'm so happy to be a part of especially that movie because it's, again, just so empowering for women, and I'm all about that, of course. so yeah of course yeah i think there's so much pressure on women especially people who are in this industry you know there's always pressures on how to look and how to be and i just want to tell people you know that there are alternatives and you can still love yourself naturally and it's important so yeah thank you so are you",
