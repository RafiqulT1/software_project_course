1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Yes, yeah, I actually, I've always sort of dealt with body image issues and things like that,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,920
but there was a particular thing that happened to me when I was in elementary school entering high school,

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:14,380
which is like the worst time for anything to happen, but I started losing my hair in copious amounts,

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,720
and I was very confused as to why it was happening, but it got to the point where I was so noticeable

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,840
that I was so self-conscious about it, and people would point it out to me,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,540
and just as, you know, transitioning from elementary school to high school, that's already a lot of pressure,

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:25,540


8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,380
And I've just always kind of dealt with that self-image issues, I guess.

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:37,480
So this song is really personal to me, but hopefully and seemingly to other people, too,

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,760
which has been really amazing and fulfilling to know that it's been touching people the way that I hoped it would.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,200
Yeah, I know. That's pretty cool. Yeah.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
No, I said, I think they misunderstood. I said, it's okay. I'm a rule breaker. I can do this. But they misunderstood and said I'm a proofreader.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,120
But I was just making a really dumb joke. I was nervous.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,480
Shania Twain was there, and I just didn't think.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,460
I was just spewing out words.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,500
But I knew that I was going to forget people, so I had to take out my piece of paper.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,280
Next year, I'm hoping to just hide away and make new music.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,740
I'm hoping to just disappear and come out of my little cave when I'm ready.

19
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,000
But, yeah, we'll see what happens.

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,740
Oh, thank you.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,540
I don't even know if I technically could because it's not really mine.

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,900
I'm just the voice on it.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,880
But I would love to.

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,020
I mean, that's such a beautiful song, and I'm so happy to be a part of especially that movie

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,880
because it's, again, just so empowering for women, and I'm all about that, of course.

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,200
so yeah of course yeah i think there's so much pressure on women especially people who are

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,860
in this industry you know there's always pressures on how to look and how to be and i just want to

28
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,920
tell people you know that there are alternatives and you can still love yourself naturally and

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,460
it's important so yeah thank you so are you
