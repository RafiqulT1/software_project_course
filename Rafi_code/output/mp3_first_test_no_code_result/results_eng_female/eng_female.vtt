00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
Yes, yeah. I actually, I've always sort of dealt with body image issues and things like that,

00:03.960 --> 00:07.920
but there was a particular thing that happened to me when I was in elementary school entering high school,

00:08.180 --> 00:09.920
which was like the worst time for anything to happen,

00:10.360 --> 00:16.180
but I started losing my hair in copious amounts, and I was very confused as to why it was happening,

00:16.280 --> 00:19.660
but it got to the point where it was so noticeable that I was so self-conscious about it,

00:19.680 --> 00:24.040
and people would point it out to me, and just as, you know, transitioning from elementary school to high school,

00:24.040 --> 00:32.060
that's already a lot of pressure, and I've just always kind of dealt with that self-image issues, I guess.

00:32.360 --> 00:37.420
So this song is really personal to me, but hopefully, and seemingly to other people too,

00:37.480 --> 00:42.240
which has been really amazing and fulfilling to know that it's been touching people the way that I hoped it would.

00:42.820 --> 00:44.600
Yeah, I know, that's pretty cool, yeah.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.800
No, I said, I think they misunderstood. I said, it's okay, I'm a rule breaker, I can do this,

00:48.880 --> 00:52.580
but they misunderstood and said I'm a proofreader, but I was just making a really dumb joke.

00:52.580 --> 00:56.460
I was nervous. Shonai Twain was there, and I just didn't think. I was just spewing out words.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.480
But I knew that I was going to forget people, so I had to take out my piece of paper.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.300
Next year, I'm hoping to just hide away and make new music.

01:03.420 --> 01:08.000
I'm hoping to just disappear and come out of my little cave when I'm ready, but yeah, we'll see what happens.

01:08.100 --> 01:11.540
Oh, thank you. I don't even know if I technically could, because it's not really mine.

01:11.580 --> 01:13.900
I'm just the voice on it, but I would love to.

01:13.980 --> 01:18.040
I mean, that's such a beautiful song, and I'm so happy to be a part of especially that movie,

01:18.040 --> 01:21.880
because it's, again, just so empowering for women, and I'm all about that, of course.

01:21.880 --> 01:27.060
Of course, yeah. I think there's so much pressure on women, especially people who are in this industry.

01:27.260 --> 01:32.040
There's always pressures on how to look and how to be, and I just want to tell people that there are alternatives,

01:32.220 --> 01:34.620
and you can still love yourself naturally, and it's important.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.320
Thank you. So are you.
