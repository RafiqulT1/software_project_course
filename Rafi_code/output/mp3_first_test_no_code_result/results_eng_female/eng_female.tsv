0	3920	Yes, yeah. I actually, I've always sort of dealt with body image issues and things like that,
3960	7920	but there was a particular thing that happened to me when I was in elementary school entering high school,
8180	9920	which was like the worst time for anything to happen,
10360	16180	but I started losing my hair in copious amounts, and I was very confused as to why it was happening,
16280	19660	but it got to the point where it was so noticeable that I was so self-conscious about it,
19680	24040	and people would point it out to me, and just as, you know, transitioning from elementary school to high school,
24040	32060	that's already a lot of pressure, and I've just always kind of dealt with that self-image issues, I guess.
32360	37420	So this song is really personal to me, but hopefully, and seemingly to other people too,
37480	42240	which has been really amazing and fulfilling to know that it's been touching people the way that I hoped it would.
42820	44600	Yeah, I know, that's pretty cool, yeah.
45200	48800	No, I said, I think they misunderstood. I said, it's okay, I'm a rule breaker, I can do this,
48880	52580	but they misunderstood and said I'm a proofreader, but I was just making a really dumb joke.
52580	56460	I was nervous. Shonai Twain was there, and I just didn't think. I was just spewing out words.
56680	59480	But I knew that I was going to forget people, so I had to take out my piece of paper.
59840	63300	Next year, I'm hoping to just hide away and make new music.
63420	68000	I'm hoping to just disappear and come out of my little cave when I'm ready, but yeah, we'll see what happens.
68100	71540	Oh, thank you. I don't even know if I technically could, because it's not really mine.
71580	73900	I'm just the voice on it, but I would love to.
73980	78040	I mean, that's such a beautiful song, and I'm so happy to be a part of especially that movie,
78040	81880	because it's, again, just so empowering for women, and I'm all about that, of course.
81880	87060	Of course, yeah. I think there's so much pressure on women, especially people who are in this industry.
87260	92040	There's always pressures on how to look and how to be, and I just want to tell people that there are alternatives,
92220	94620	and you can still love yourself naturally, and it's important.
95220	96320	Thank you. So are you.
