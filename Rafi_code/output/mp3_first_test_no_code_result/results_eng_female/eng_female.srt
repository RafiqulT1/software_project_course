1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Yes, yeah. I actually, I've always sort of dealt with body image issues and things like that,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,920
but there was a particular thing that happened to me when I was in elementary school entering high school,

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,920
which was like the worst time for anything to happen,

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,180
but I started losing my hair in copious amounts, and I was very confused as to why it was happening,

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,660
but it got to the point where it was so noticeable that I was so self-conscious about it,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,040
and people would point it out to me, and just as, you know, transitioning from elementary school to high school,

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:32,060
that's already a lot of pressure, and I've just always kind of dealt with that self-image issues, I guess.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,420
So this song is really personal to me, but hopefully, and seemingly to other people too,

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,240
which has been really amazing and fulfilling to know that it's been touching people the way that I hoped it would.

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,600
Yeah, I know, that's pretty cool, yeah.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
No, I said, I think they misunderstood. I said, it's okay, I'm a rule breaker, I can do this,

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,580
but they misunderstood and said I'm a proofreader, but I was just making a really dumb joke.

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,460
I was nervous. Shonai Twain was there, and I just didn't think. I was just spewing out words.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,480
But I knew that I was going to forget people, so I had to take out my piece of paper.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,300
Next year, I'm hoping to just hide away and make new music.

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm hoping to just disappear and come out of my little cave when I'm ready, but yeah, we'll see what happens.

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,540
Oh, thank you. I don't even know if I technically could, because it's not really mine.

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,900
I'm just the voice on it, but I would love to.

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,040
I mean, that's such a beautiful song, and I'm so happy to be a part of especially that movie,

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,880
because it's, again, just so empowering for women, and I'm all about that, of course.

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,060
Of course, yeah. I think there's so much pressure on women, especially people who are in this industry.

22
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,040
There's always pressures on how to look and how to be, and I just want to tell people that there are alternatives,

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,620
and you can still love yourself naturally, and it's important.

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,320
Thank you. So are you.
