Yes, yeah, I actually, I've always sort of dealt with body image issues and things like that,

00:03.960 --> 00:07.920
but there was a particular thing that happened to me when I was in elementary school entering high school,

00:08.180 --> 00:14.380
which is like the worst time for anything to happen, but I started losing my hair in copious amounts,

00:14.380 --> 00:17.720
and I was very confused as to why it was happening, but it got to the point where I was so noticeable

00:17.720 --> 00:20.840
that I was so self-conscious about it, and people would point it out to me,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.540
and just as, you know, transitioning from elementary school to high school, that's already a lot of pressure,

00:25.760 --> 00:25.540


00:32.060 --> 00:32.380
And I've just always kind of dealt with that self-image issues, I guess.

00:37.420 --> 00:37.480
So this song is really personal to me, but hopefully and seemingly to other people, too,

00:42.240 --> 00:42.760
which has been really amazing and fulfilling to know that it's been touching people the way that I hoped it would.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.200
Yeah, I know. That's pretty cool. Yeah.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.800
No, I said, I think they misunderstood. I said, it's okay. I'm a rule breaker. I can do this. But they misunderstood and said I'm a proofreader.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.120
But I was just making a really dumb joke. I was nervous.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.480
Shania Twain was there, and I just didn't think.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.460
I was just spewing out words.

00:56.700 --> 00:59.500
But I knew that I was going to forget people, so I had to take out my piece of paper.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.280
Next year, I'm hoping to just hide away and make new music.

01:03.420 --> 01:06.740
I'm hoping to just disappear and come out of my little cave when I'm ready.

01:06.980 --> 01:08.000
But, yeah, we'll see what happens.

01:08.100 --> 01:08.740
Oh, thank you.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.540
I don't even know if I technically could because it's not really mine.

01:11.580 --> 01:12.900
I'm just the voice on it.

01:13.000 --> 01:13.880
But I would love to.

01:13.960 --> 01:18.020
I mean, that's such a beautiful song, and I'm so happy to be a part of especially that movie

01:18.020 --> 01:21.880
because it's, again, just so empowering for women, and I'm all about that, of course.

01:21.880 --> 01:26.200
so yeah of course yeah i think there's so much pressure on women especially people who are

01:26.200 --> 01:29.860
in this industry you know there's always pressures on how to look and how to be and i just want to

01:29.860 --> 01:33.920
tell people you know that there are alternatives and you can still love yourself naturally and

01:33.920 --> 01:36.460
it's important so yeah thank you so are you
